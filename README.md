# hello-dark-world
new to code

My name is Davey, I have no clue on what I am doing right now however I am trying to learn how to create and set up a repository.
I live in Chicago.
I am a bartender.
My heart was broken when I moved here. I am trying my best to recover and learn a new skill in coding.
I want to dissapear from the map and live somewhere next to a warm ocean where I can surf everyday.
